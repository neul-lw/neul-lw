Hi! I'm Neul. I have interest in programming and want to become good at. Currently, I'm focusing on Web Development, I'm learning basic JavaScript and plan to become a Back-end Django Developer.
But my interest more broad than becoming a Web Developer, I want to be able to use programming in my personal life to automate, develop, do experiments with stuff.
